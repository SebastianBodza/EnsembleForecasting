# EnsembleForecasting
Using multiple LLMs for ensemble Forecasting. 

Got the Idea from participation in a Kaggle Challenges with Tabular-Data and TimeSeries-Data. Showing massive performance boost from Ensembling multiple Models with simple averaging of the results. Especially in uncertainty! Why not also for LLMs? 

First unoptized proof of concept with two quantized (AWQ) Models. Can also be run on Colab!
